# Roadmap: Generate-Weekly-PDFs-DSR-Resiliency

## Milestones

- ✅ **v1.0 Subcontractor Rate Logic** — Phases 01 + 01.1 (shipped 2026-05-20).
  Full detail archived in [`milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md`](milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md).

- ✅ **v1.0 hotfix line** — Phase 02 (Attribution Bulk-Prefetch + Historical
  Claimer Remediation, shipped 2026-05-26). 6 plans (4 + 2 gap-closure).

- ✅ **v1.1 Portal — Supabase-native Artifact Portal** — Phases 03–07 (shipped
  2026-06-03). Replaces the Express backend with a Supabase-native architecture.
  Supersedes the prior Railway → Render migration (moved to Out of Scope).
  (Not yet formally archived via `/gsd-complete-milestone` — pending Phase 06
  manual UAT.)

- 🔧 **v1.2 smartsheet-python-sdk 4.0.0 Compatibility Migration** — Phase 08.
  Compat-only migration to SDK 4.0.0 so the temporary `<4.0.0` pin (hotfix
  260608-gwm / PR #273) can be lifted, with zero behavior change to the billing
  pipeline.

- 🏗️ **v1.3 Engine Modularization & Hygiene** — Phase 09. Split the 10,476-line
  `generate_weekly_pdfs.py` into a cohesive `pipeline/` package (facade-preserved,
  behavior-neutral) for debuggability and bug isolation. Started while v1.2 is
  paused; localizing SDK touch-points also eases the later v1.2 migration.
  Assessment: [`docs/refactor-assessment-generate-weekly-pdfs.md`](../docs/refactor-assessment-generate-weekly-pdfs.md).

  incident) with single bulk RPC + fail-safe reader; drops
  `ATTRIBUTION_RESOLUTION_WEEKS` footgun; adds default-OFF dry-run-first
  remediation sweep; makes reader deploy-order-tolerant.

Full phase details in main ROADMAP.md Phase 2 section below (archived inline).

</details>

### v1.1 Portal — Supabase-native Artifact Portal

- [x] **Phase 03: Supabase Data Layer Foundation** — `public.artifacts` + `public.profiles` (completed 2026-05-29)
  DDL, role-aware RLS, private Storage bucket, additive publish step in CI.

- [x] **Phase 04: Auth, RBAC, and Deployment** — hCaptcha-hardened login/signup/reset,
  `profiles`-backed role system, admin user management, Vercel deploy correctness. (completed 2026-06-01)

- [x] **Phase 05: Artifact Table and Search** — virtualized table on real Supabase data, (completed 2026-06-02)
  mock fallback removed, debounced search, variant filter, sortable columns.

- [x] **Phase 06: Realtime and UI Polish** — Supabase Realtime INSERT subscription,
  Framer Motion animations, responsive layout, accessible visual design. (completed automated scope 2026-06-02; manual UAT pending)

- [x] **Phase 07: Security Hardening and Express Removal** — CSP/headers, full RLS audit,
  signed-URL scoping verification, secret handling audit, `portal/` directory removed. ✅ 2026-06-03

### v1.2 smartsheet-python-sdk 4.0.0 Compatibility Migration

- [ ] **Phase 08: smartsheet-python-sdk 4.0.0 Compatibility Migration** —
  reconcile exception-class imports + retry blocks + the `smartsheet.smartsheet`
  re-export workaround with 4.0.0's module layout, verify all in-use SDK call
  sites (`Sheets.get_sheet`, `Attachments.*`, `Folders.get_folder_children`),
  update test mocks, pass full `pytest` under 4.0.0, then lift the `<4.0.0`
  pin. Compat-only — zero behavior change to the billing pipeline. (SDK-01..06)

### v1.3 Engine Modularization & Hygiene

- [ ] **Phase 09: Engine Modularization (pipeline package split)** — relocate the
  10,476-line `generate_weekly_pdfs.py` into a `pipeline/` package, one cohesive
  module per PR, leaf-first, keeping the root file as a thin facade that re-exports
  all 106 public names + `__main__`. Behavior-neutral (no logic or billing-guard
  changes; no dead-code removal). `pytest`/`py_compile`/`mypy` green at every step.
  Bakes in the cross-module `global`-rebind `__getattr__` live-proxy mitigation.
  Assessment in `docs/refactor-assessment-generate-weekly-pdfs.md`. (MOD-01..11)

## Phase Details

### Phase 02: Attribution Bulk-Prefetch + Historical Claimer Remediation

**Goal:** Every generated Excel file is partitioned/named by the real frozen
claimer from `billing_audit.attribution_snapshot` (no `_NO_MATCH` /
`Unknown_Foreman` for rows that have a frozen claimer), with no time-budget
regression, so Sub-project E (`SUPABASE_HASH_STORE_AUTHORITATIVE=1`, clean
filenames) can be safely re-activated.

**Depends on:** Phase 01.1 (and the shipped Foundation A / B / C / D / E
attribution work tracked in `docs/superpowers/`)

**Requirements:** 6 locked in 02-SPEC.md (SPEC-1 bulk prefetch; SPEC-2 correct
claimer on every file; SPEC-3 no time-budget regression; SPEC-4 recent-window
remediation; SPEC-5 safe Sub-project E re-activation; SPEC-6 regression coverage).

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. A billing run completes within the 180-minute budget with zero `_NO_MATCH` / `_Unknown_Foreman` filenames for groups that have a frozen claimer in `attribution_snapshot`.
2. The single bulk `lookup_attribution_bulk` RPC replaces all four per-variant ThreadPoolExecutor pre-passes; per-row fallback fires only on `rpc_missing`.
3. `ATTRIBUTION_RESOLUTION_WEEKS` env var is fully removed from code, workflow, and docs.
4. `run_claimer_remediation` (default OFF, dry-run-first) can be dispatched and sweep obsolete garbage-named attachments without touching live-identity files.
5. Sub-project E re-activation runbook (D-09/D-10/D-11) is documented; the flip to `SUPABASE_HASH_STORE_AUTHORITATIVE=1` is a separate human-gated operator action.
6. `pytest tests/ -v` passes green with historical-claimer RED/GREEN regression coverage.

**Plans:** 6 plans (4 executed + 2 gap-closure from 02-REVIEW.md)

**Wave 1**

- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Bulk RPC (`lookup_attribution_bulk`) + fail-safe `prefetch_attribution` reader + map-aware `resolve_claimer`
- [x] 02-05-PLAN.md — CR-01 graceful degradation (`rpc_missing` + `ATTRIBUTION_BULK_PREFETCH_FALLBACK`) + WR-01 sanitization key + WR-03 comment + WR-05 sub-helper observability + IN-01 dead imports (gap-closure)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1)*

- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Wire 4 pre-pass sites to bulk map + drop `ATTRIBUTION_RESOLUTION_WEEKS` + historical-claimer regression
- [x] 02-06-PLAN.md — WR-02 `advanced_options` activation path + WR-04 `_Unknown_Foreman` protection + IN-02 counter + IN-03 runbook quote + IN-04 datetime + Living Ledger (gap-closure)

**Wave 3** *(blocked on Wave 2)*

- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — Default-OFF, dry-run-first, isolated `run_claimer_remediation` garbage sweep (TARGET + PPP, live-identity exempt)

**Wave 4** *(blocked on Wave 3)*

- [x] 02-04-PLAN.md — E re-activation runbook (D-09/D-10/D-11 gated flip) + Living Ledger entry

---

### Phase 03: Supabase Data Layer Foundation

**Goal:** The Supabase backend is fully provisioned — schema, RLS, Storage, and
publish step — so every CI billing run lands an artifact row in `public.artifacts`
and a file in the private Storage bucket, accessible only to `admin` and `billing`
roles.

**Depends on:** Phase 02 (last shipped phase; nothing in v1.1 depends on billing
pipeline internals, but DATA-03 appends to the same workflow)

**Requirements:** DATA-01, DATA-02, DATA-03, DATA-04, DATA-05

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. A manually dispatched `weekly-excel-generation.yml` run completes successfully and the new publish step deposits at least one row in `public.artifacts` and one file in the `excel-artifacts` Storage bucket.
2. An anonymous `curl` against `/rest/v1/artifacts` returns an empty array (RLS blocks public reads); a `pending`-role authenticated user also receives zero artifact rows.
3. Signed download URLs (5-minute TTL) work for `admin` and `billing` role users and return 403/expired for unauthenticated requests.
4. A Supabase outage simulation (`continue-on-error: true`) causes the publish step to exit non-zero without failing the billing run, Smartsheet upload, or `hash_history` persistence.
5. `portal-v2` fetches artifact metadata directly via `supabase-js` with no Express backend in the path.

**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete

Plans:
**Wave 1**

- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — public.artifacts + public.profiles DDL, role-aware RLS (artifacts/profiles/storage.objects), private excel-artifacts bucket (operator-applied)
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — scripts/publish_artifacts_to_supabase.py (TDD: mocked Wave 0 tests + fail-isolated Storage upload + sha256 upsert)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*

- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md — additive continue-on-error Supabase publish step wired into weekly-excel-generation.yml

**UI hint**: no

---

### Phase 04: Auth, RBAC, and Deployment

**Goal:** Users can securely access the portal through a hCaptcha-hardened login
gate, new signups default to `pending` (zero data access), admins can assign roles,
and the Vercel deployment is correctly connected and serving the portal at a working
URL.

**Depends on:** Phase 03 (`public.profiles` DDL + role-aware RLS in place)

**Requirements:** AUTH-01, AUTH-02, AUTH-03, AUTH-04, AUTH-05, AUTH-06, RBAC-01,
RBAC-02, RBAC-03, RBAC-04, RBAC-05, DEPLOY-01, DEPLOY-02, DEPLOY-03, DEPLOY-04

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. A user can sign in with email/password through hCaptcha and remain authenticated across browser sessions (when "Remember me" is checked) or only for the current tab session (when unchecked).
2. A newly self-signed-up user is assigned `role=pending` automatically (via DB trigger) and sees an approval screen — not the artifact table — after login.
3. An admin can visit `/admin/users`, view all profiles, change a user's role, and is blocked from demoting themselves if they are the last admin.
4. A `pending`-role user is redirected to the login/approval page from any protected route; a `billing`-role user reaches the artifact table; an `admin`-role user reaches both the artifact table and `/admin/users`.
5. The Vercel deployment serves the portal at the production URL, deep links do not 404 (SPA rewrite active), and the `service_role` key is absent from all Vercel env vars.
6. Password reset (email → `/auth/reset` → `updateUser`) works end-to-end with hCaptcha on a Vercel preview deployment.

**Plans:** 6/6 plans complete ✅ (Phase closed 2026-06-01)

Plans:
**Wave 1** *(foundation + live-bug fixes; 01 and 02 run in parallel)*

- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — vitest infra + types.ts reconciliation + supabase.ts fail-loud factory/Remember-Me + ConfigError + hCaptcha install
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — schema DDL (email/created_at + handle_new_user SECURITY DEFINER trigger + last-admin guard) + bootstrap runbook + [BLOCKING] manual live-DB apply (autonomous:false)

**Wave 2** *(auth core)*

- [x] 04-03-PLAN.md — useAuth extension (captcha/remember-me/resetPassword/role helpers) + AuthGuard USE_MOCK removal & pending routing + RoleGuard + guard tests

**Wave 3** *(auth surfaces)*

- [x] 04-04-PLAN.md — LoginPage (hCaptcha/remember-me/forgot link/post-signup→/pending) + ForgotPasswordPage + ResetPasswordPage + PendingApprovalPage

**Wave 4** *(RBAC integration + routing)*

- [x] 04-05-PLAN.md — UsersPage reconciliation + last-admin UI guard + pending highlight + states + UsersPage test; delete ActivityPage; App.tsx routes + RoleGuard; Sidebar cleanup; dead-type removal

**Wave 5** *(deployment)*

- [x] 04-06-PLAN.md — vercel.json SPA-rewrite verify + service_role grep + deployment runbook + full-build gate + [BLOCKING] Vercel connect/env-vars/live-deploy checkpoint (autonomous:false) — verified public prod + SPA deep links 200; Vercel Auth disabled (DEPLOY-04 root cause)

**UI hint**: yes

---

### Phase 05: Artifact Table and Search

**Goal:** The billing team can see, search, filter, sort, and download their
generated Excel artifacts from a fast, virtualized table that reads real Supabase
data — with no mock fallback anywhere in the path.

**Depends on:** Phase 04 (authenticated session + role gates verified end-to-end;
at least one artifact row in `public.artifacts` from Phase 03 CI run)

**Requirements:** TABLE-01, TABLE-02, TABLE-03, TABLE-04, TABLE-05, SEARCH-01,
SEARCH-02, SEARCH-03, SEARCH-04

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. A `billing`-role user sees a table of real artifacts (WR #, week-ending date, variant, file size, created date, download action) populated from `public.artifacts` — no mock rows anywhere.
2. Clicking a download button generates a signed URL at click time, shows an in-progress state, and delivers the `.xlsx` file; a network error shows an error toast (not a silent failure).
3. Typing in the search bar debounces (250ms) and filters the table by WR # or week-ending date via a Postgres `ilike` query; the variant multi-select filter and column sort combine with the search (results satisfy all active constraints simultaneously).
4. The table renders 500+ rows without UI jank — row virtualization keeps the DOM shallow and memory flat.
5. The table shows distinct, non-overlapping loading skeleton, empty state, and error-with-retry states; a genuine fetch failure surfaces an actionable error (not fake rows).

**Plans:** 4/4 plans complete

Plans:
**Wave 1** *(foundation — deps, provider, types, pure helpers)*

- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md — install 3 TanStack deps + mount QueryClientProvider + BillingArtifact type + searchNormalize/sanitize (D-08) + variantLabels (D-10) + useDebounce, RED tests first

**Wave 2** *(data layer — blocked on Wave 1)*

- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md — useArtifactsInfinite (supabase.from('artifacts') useInfiniteQuery + combinable .or/.in/.order/.range, DATA-04/TABLE-03) + useDownloadArtifact (300s signed URL + browser download + error toast, TABLE-04/DATA-05) + remove the silent mock fallback (TABLE-02/D-02)

**Wave 3** *(table UI — blocked on Wave 2)*

- [x] 05-03-PLAN.md — ArtifactTable (TanStack Virtual + manualSorting + 4 D-07 states + infinite scroll) + memoized ArtifactTableRow (6 TABLE-01 columns + download) + ArtifactEmptyState; render at /dashboard, stop rendering legacy runs view (D-01/D-02)

**Wave 4** *(search/filter/sort — blocked on Wave 3)*

- [x] 05-04-PLAN.md — ArtifactSearchBar (debounced 250ms, SEARCH-01) + VariantFilterBar (dynamic friendly-label multi-select + clearable chips, SEARCH-02/D-10) + wire search+variants+sort into useArtifactsInfinite params so they combine server-side (SEARCH-03/SEARCH-04)

**UI hint**: yes

---

### Phase 06: Realtime and UI Polish

**Goal:** The portal feels alive and polished — new artifacts surface via a
Realtime toast (no page refresh needed), the layout is responsive across all
device widths, animations are tasteful and non-blocking, and the design is
accessible and visually consistent.

**Depends on:** Phase 05 (stable artifact table to animate and subscribe against)

**Requirements:** DATA-06, UI-01, UI-02, UI-03

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. When a CI billing run completes and inserts new artifact rows, a toast notification appears in the open portal within a few seconds — without auto-inserting rows mid-scroll or leaking the Realtime subscription on unmount.
2. The portal is fully usable on desktop, tablet, and narrow mobile widths — priority columns (WR #, week-ending, download) are always visible; secondary columns collapse gracefully.
3. Row entrance animations (Framer Motion `AnimatePresence` + `motion.tr` stagger) play on initial load without degrading table scroll performance.
4. All interactive elements are keyboard-navigable, color contrast meets WCAG AA, and the design is visually consistent using the existing `GlassCard`, `Badge`, `Skeleton`, and `Toast` primitives.

**Build note (carried from Phase 05 — operator requirement):** The Phase 06 plan
MUST invoke the `/frontend-design` skill for the artifact table + search/filter
surface. Phase 05 was deliberately functional-only and reused the existing design
system; the distinctive-design pass was explicitly deferred here. Also fold in the
non-blocking Phase 05 code-review warnings best handled during polish: WR-05 (two
`ToastContainer` stacks — App.tsx vs ArtifactTable.tsx) and WR-03 (the
`['artifact-variants']` query fetches all rows for client-side dedup — add a
`.limit()` cap + longer `staleTime`). Source: `05-REVIEW.md`.

**Plans:** 5/5 plans complete

Plans:
**Wave 1** *(foundation — parallel; no file overlap)*

- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — [BLOCKING] verify/enable `artifacts` in the `supabase_realtime` publication (DATA-06 gate) + install jest-axe + wire `expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations)` into test setup (D-07 automated) (autonomous:false)
- [x] 06-02-PLAN.md — `ToastContext` single global toast stack (C-01/D-06) + App.tsx rewire inside QueryClientProvider + ArtifactTable consumes context (no local container) + C-02 `.limit(2000)`+`staleTime` variant query (D-08)

**Wave 2** *(Realtime — blocked on 01+02)*

- [x] 06-03-PLAN.md — `useRealtimeArtifacts` count-only role-gated leak-free hook + mock-channel tests (D-03/D-04/D-05) + `NewArtifactPill` + wire count-only info toast + persistent "Load N" pill into ArtifactTable (DATA-06/UI-02)

**Wave 3** *(responsive + animation — blocked on 03)*

- [x] 06-04-PLAN.md — mobile `ArtifactCard` + responsive table↔card swap (UI-01) + opacity-only initial-load row stagger via `staggerDelay`/`initialLoadComplete` (UI-02) + WCAG slate-400→slate-500 upgrade (UI-03)

**Wave 4** *(polish + manual a11y — blocked on 02/03/04)*

- [x] 06-05-PLAN.md — `/frontend-design` propose-then-approve polish pass within locked UI-SPEC tokens (D-01/D-02) + D-07 manual WCAG-AA/keyboard/screen-reader/contrast + live-Realtime UAT walkthrough (autonomous:false)

**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 9: Engine Modularization (pipeline package split)

**Goal:** Relocate the 10,476-line `generate_weekly_pdfs.py` into a cohesive
`pipeline/` package (one responsibility per module), reducing the root file to a
thin PEP-562 facade that re-exports all public names + `__main__` and live-proxies
the 4 runtime-rebound globals — with ZERO behavior change and the full `pytest`
suite + 6-gate harness green at every step.

**Requirements:** MOD-01..MOD-06 (derived from 09-SPEC.md; no IDs in ROADMAP):
MOD-01 pipeline/ decomposition · MOD-02 facade public-API preservation ·
MOD-03 live-proxy globals · MOD-04 behavior neutrality (billing guards byte-for-byte) ·
MOD-05 no dead-code removal · MOD-06 per-step verification gates green.

**Depends on:** Phase 8 (must NOT run concurrently — same file; D-07)

**Plans:** 4/7 plans executed

Plans:
**Wave 1**

- [x] 09-00-PLAN.md — Wave 0: D-06 pre-flight commit + 6-gate harness (TDD) + frozen baselines + empty pipeline/ scaffold
- [x] 09-01-PLAN.md — Wave 1: config + utils + observability (init_sentry import-time preserved, D-04)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*

- [x] 09-02-PLAN.md — Wave 2: pricing + change_detection (late-import _RATES_FINGERPRINT + _billing_audit_writer kwarg)

**Wave 3** *(blocked on Wave 2 completion)*

- [x] 09-03-PLAN.md — Wave 3: discovery + fetch + PEP-562 __getattr__ live-proxy for the 4 rebound globals (D-01)

**Wave 4** *(blocked on Wave 3 completion)*

- [x] 09-04-PLAN.md — Wave 4: grouping + excel (helper exclusion + safe_merge_cells guards byte-for-byte)

**Wave 5** *(blocked on Wave 4 completion)*

- [ ] 09-05-PLAN.md — Wave 5: cleanup + upload + attribution (separate lifecycle modules)

**Wave 6** *(blocked on Wave 5 completion)*

- [ ] 09-06-PLAN.md — Wave 6: orchestrate (main) + thin-facade finalization + phase-close human verify

**Cross-cutting constraints:**

- All 6 gates green; no symbol deleted

---

### Phase 07: Security Hardening and Express Removal

**Goal:** The portal passes a full security review — RLS is verified air-tight,
security headers are in place, secrets are correctly scoped, signed URLs are
properly short-lived and single-object scoped — and the Express backend
(`portal/`) is permanently removed now that the Supabase-native portal is
confirmed working.

**Depends on:** Phase 06 (portal fully functional end-to-end before removing
the legacy debugging surface)

**Requirements:** SEC-01, SEC-02, SEC-03, SEC-04, SEC-05

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. An anonymous request to `/rest/v1/artifacts` returns an empty array; a Storage anonymous GET returns 403; a `pending`-role user receives zero artifact rows and cannot generate a signed URL — all verified against the live Vercel deployment.
2. Security headers are present on all Vercel responses: `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, HSTS.
3. `grep -r SERVICE_ROLE portal-v2/` returns nothing; `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is absent from Vercel env vars; the `service_role` key exists only in GitHub Actions Secrets and Supabase project settings.
4. A `/security-review` checklist pass finds no HIGH/critical RLS, signed-URL scoping, or secret-handling findings; all findings at that severity are resolved and documented before milestone close.
5. The `portal/` Express backend directory is deleted, `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is removed from all env configs, and the Vercel SPA rewrite in `vercel.json` remains intact and working after Express removal.

**Plans:** 4 plans

Plans:
**Wave 1**

- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md — SEC-02 security headers + Report-Only CSP on vercel.json; live zero-violation walkthrough (✅ complete 2026-06-02, zero violations, US Sentry confirmed)
- [x] 07-02-PLAN.md — Live RLS/signed-URL probe (scripts/security-probe.ts, anon + pending JWT only) + SEC-05 audit (✅ complete 2026-06-02, EXIT:0 all 4 PASS, SEC-05 confirmed TTL=300)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*

- [x] 07-03-PLAN.md — Express removal (sever -> grep-gate -> git rm portal/ -> smoke test) + SEC-03 secret gate + CSP enforce-flip (✅ complete 2026-06-02; 6-step smoke test PASS, SEC-03 PASS, CSP enforcing)

**Wave 3** *(blocked on Wave 2 completion)*

- [x] 07-04-PLAN.md — security-reviewer skill + gsd-secure-phase 07 (both D-05 auditors) + Dependabot critical/high CVE remediation; author 07-SECURITY.md (✅ complete 2026-06-03; threats_open:0/verified, HIGH-03 AuthGuard race fixed, stale schema deleted, 9 moderates deferred)

**UI hint**: no

### Phase 08: smartsheet-python-sdk 4.0.0 Compatibility Migration

**Milestone:** v1.2

**Goal:** Make the production Python billing engine (`generate_weekly_pdfs.py`,
`audit_billing_changes.py`, `diagnose_pricing_issues.py`, and the test suite)
fully compatible with `smartsheet-python-sdk` 4.0.0, then lift the temporary
`>=3.1.0,<4.0.0` pin — with **zero behavior change** to the
Smartsheet → Excel → Smartsheet pipeline. Compat-only; explicitly NOT a redesign
or optimization pass.

**Requirements:** SDK-01, SDK-02, SDK-03, SDK-04, SDK-05, SDK-06

**Depends on:** Hotfix 260608-gwm / PR #273 (the `<4.0.0` pin that keeps
production green while this migration is planned and executed). Execution must
be based on **current `origin/master`** (local `master` has diverged 10/10 and
must be reconciled first).

**Known surface (from the 4.0.0 changelog, fetched 2026-06-08):**

- BREAKING and **relevant**: `smartsheet.exceptions` module relocated/removed →
  the line-28 import, the retry `except` blocks, and the `smartsheet.smartsheet`
  re-export workaround. Research must confirm where the retryable exception
  classes live in 4.0.0.

- BREAKING but **NOT used** by this codebase (no action expected, verify):
  removed `Folders.get_folder`/`list_folders` + `Templates`; token-pagination
  changes to `list_workspaces`/`list_sights`/`list_webhooks`. The code already
  uses `Folders.get_folder_children` with `last_key` pagination, which 4.0.0
  standardizes on.

**Success criteria:**

1. A clean install of `smartsheet-python-sdk==4.0.0` lets
   `python -m py_compile generate_weekly_pdfs.py` and the import of all four
   retryable exception classes succeed (no `ModuleNotFoundError`/`AttributeError`).

2. `pytest tests/ -v` passes in full against SDK 4.0.0, with test mocks/fixtures
   updated for any relocated symbols.

3. A `TEST_MODE=true` (and/or `SKIP_UPLOAD=true`) run produces byte-identical
   grouping and Excel output vs. the 3.x baseline for the same inputs — proving
   no behavior change.

4. `requirements.txt` is updated to allow 4.0.0 (pin lifted) and the Living
   Ledger / CLAUDE.md SDK-pin notes reflect the migration.

5. The production weekly workflow runs green on 4.0.0 (observed on the next
   scheduled cron after merge).

**Plans:** TBD — run `/gsd-plan-phase 08` (focused SDK research → planner →
plan-checker). The 4.0.0 CHANGELOG is already indexed in the context-mode KB
under source `smartsheet-sdk-changelog`.
