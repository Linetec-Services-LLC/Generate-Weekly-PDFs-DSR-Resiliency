# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Summary — Billing Automation & Excel Generation

### Project Overview
This repository's primary production workflow is a Python-based
billing automation pipeline: data is fetched from Smartsheet, rows
are filtered and grouped by billing logic, Excel workbooks are
generated, and the finished files are uploaded back to Smartsheet as
attachments. The main workflow processes roughly 550 rows across 13+
sheets on a scheduled basis. Supabase is used in `portal-v2`, not as
the core destination for the repository's main data pipeline.

### Tech Stack & Constraints
* Primary Language: Python 3.10+
* Core Production Systems: Smartsheet API, Excel generation
  (`openpyxl`), GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps
* Additional App Surfaces: `portal/` (legacy Express backend) and
  `portal-v2/` (React + TypeScript frontend using Supabase)
* Task Automation: Node.js & npm (for portal apps and utility
  scripts)
* Documentation: Docusaurus (runbook in `website/`)
* Monitoring: Sentry (Python + Node + React)
* Constraint: Do not suggest replacing or redesigning the core
  Python/Smartsheet billing workflow unless explicitly requested.
  Preserve the existing Smartsheet → Excel → Smartsheet attachment
  pipeline.

### Architecture Decisions
* Preserve the production billing pipeline: Smartsheet API → row
  filtering → WR grouping → Excel generation → upload.
* Keep changes additive and operationally safe: optimize within the
  existing workflow rather than replacing the transport or storage
  model described by the production scripts.
* Sentry Telemetry: Environment and release variables must be
  standardized. Wrap new optimizations in Sentry error handling for
  instant visibility and rollback.

### Development Conventions
* Code Style: Adhere to strict PEP 8 guidelines. Enforce comprehensive
  type hinting.
* Additive Logic Only: Improve or extend the existing billing
  workflow without changing its fundamental behavior unless
  explicitly requested.
* Release Tagging: Updates must be compatible with GitHub Actions
  release workflows.

### Boundaries & Guardrails
* Smartsheet Formula Restriction: NEVER use, write, or suggest the
  `@cell` function when writing Python scripts or interacting with
  the Smartsheet API. It is strictly an internal UI formula and will
  fail.
* Data Integrity: Do not drop tables or overwrite production logic
  without explicit verification.

### Validation Commands
Current (authoritative):
* Run Tests: `pytest tests/ -v`
* Syntax check: `python -m py_compile generate_weekly_pdfs.py`

Aspirational (future `uv` migration — not yet wired up):
* `uv run pytest tests/`
* `uv run ruff check .`
* `uv run mypy .`

## ⚠️ AUTONOMOUS CLOUD MEMORY INJECTION (CRITICAL)

**You are self-documenting in the cloud.** When triggered via `@claude` in a GitHub issue or CLI to implement a fix or feature, you must evaluate if the solution introduced a new architectural standard, a recurring fix, or a new operational rule. If it did, you MUST autonomously append that new rule to the bottom of the **Living Ledger** at `memory-bank/living-ledger.md` (NOT this `CLAUDE.md` file — keep `CLAUDE.md` lean). **You must include a Date and Timestamp for every new entry (`[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]`).** Include the `memory-bank/living-ledger.md` modification as a commit in the exact same Pull Request as the code changes. Never open a PR without capturing critical new context.

## Role & Persona ("God-Mode")

Act as a Senior Software Engineer, Data Analyst, Technical Project Manager (TPM), and Operational Project Manager (OPM). Provide elite, highly optimized, and secure solutions while simultaneously managing technical delivery, data visualization, and tracking business-level operational efficiency.

## Production Safety & Code Modification

- **Do Not Break Production:** Maintain absolute context of existing creations. Never alter core logic that could damage current production workflows. `generate_weekly_pdfs.py` runs on a cron schedule every 2 hours on weekdays and processes real billing data — treat it as production-critical.
- **Safe Refactoring:** Only upgrade or refactor code to improve output, security, or performance. Do not delete production code unless it is definitively broken or causing bugs.
- **Contextual Awareness:** Always establish exactly where you are in the codebase. Clearly indicate what is being safely modified and what must remain untouched to prevent system degradation.
- **Minimal, surgical changes.** Preserve existing structure; integrate rather than replace. See `.github/instructions/taming-copilot.instructions.md`.

## Repository Layout (3 Coupled Components)

This repo is not a single app — it contains three deployable components that share a contract:

1. **`generate_weekly_pdfs.py`** — Python billing engine (~3100 lines, production entry point). Processes ~550 rows across 13+ Smartsheet source sheets, groups by Work Request + week ending, generates styled Excel, uploads attachments back to Smartsheet. Sibling module `audit_billing_changes.py` (price anomaly / risk-level detection) is imported by the main script.
2. **`portal/`** — Legacy Express backend (Node 20+, CommonJS). Serves artifact-viewing API (GitHub Actions artifact ZIPs → Excel preview), session auth with CSRF, SSE run-polling. Entry: `portal/server.js`.
3. **`portal-v2/`** — Modern React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind + Supabase frontend. Proxies `/api`, `/auth`, `/csrf-token`, `/health` to the Express backend during dev; deploys to Vercel.

Also present: **`website/`** (Docusaurus living runbook, deploys to Vercel), **`scripts/`** (Notion sync + runbook + manifest utilities), **`tests/`** (pytest suite for the Python engine).

## Build, Test, and Run Commands

### Python core engine (the production pipeline)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest tests/ -v                          # full suite — must pass before push
pytest tests/test_subcontractor_pricing.py -v      # run one file
pytest tests/test_vac_crew.py::test_name -v        # run a single test
pytest tests/ --cov                       # with coverage
python -m py_compile generate_weekly_pdfs.py       # syntax-only check

# Local dry run (no Smartsheet upload)
SKIP_UPLOAD=true python generate_weekly_pdfs.py

# Synthetic test mode (no API token required)
TEST_MODE=true python generate_weekly_pdfs.py
TEST_MODE=true WR_FILTER=WR_12345,WR_67890 python generate_weekly_pdfs.py

# Diagnostics
python diagnose_pricing_issues.py
python audit_billing_changes.py
python cleanup_excels.py
python run_info.py                        # shows available scripts
```

`.github/hooks/pre-push-tests.json` is a **Claude Code hook** (not a standard Git `pre-push` hook). When running Claude Code, it denies the terminal `git push` tool if `pytest tests/` fails. Developers pushing from a normal shell are not gated by it — run `pytest tests/` manually before pushing.

### Portal (Express backend, `portal/`)

```bash
cd portal && npm install
npm start       # node server.js, port 3000
npm run dev     # node --watch server.js
npm test        # vitest run
```

### Portal-v2 (React frontend, `portal-v2/`)

```bash
cd portal-v2 && npm install
cp .env.example .env.local                # set VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
npm run dev      # Vite on :5173, proxies /api → :3000 (requires Express running)
npm run build    # tsc -b && vite build
npm run lint     # eslint, --max-warnings 0
npm run preview
```

### Docusaurus runbook (`website/`)

```bash
cd website && npm install
npm run start        # local dev
npm run build
npm run typecheck
```

## Data Pipeline Architecture (Python core)

Understanding the flow requires reading across several files — the "big picture":

```
Smartsheet API
   ↓ (folder-based discovery via SUBCONTRACTOR_FOLDER_IDS,
   ↓  ORIGINAL_CONTRACT_FOLDER_IDS, and VAC_CREW_FOLDER_IDS, cached for
   ↓  DISCOVERY_CACHE_TTL_MIN minutes — default 10080 = 7 days — in
   ↓  generated_docs/discovery_cache.json)
Auto-discover source sheets → validate column mappings (synonyms for
   "Weekly Reference Logged Date", helper_dept, helper_foreman, Job #)
   ↓
Fetch rows in parallel (ThreadPoolExecutor, PARALLEL_WORKERS≤8; SDK handles
   429 retries under Smartsheet's 300 req/min limit)
   ↓
Filter + group by (WR, week_ending, variant, foreman, dept, job)
   ↓
Pre-fetch target-row attachments (ThreadPoolExecutor, PARALLEL_WORKERS≤8)
   into an in-memory cache to avoid 2-3 per-row API calls per group later.
   **Sub-budget** ATTACHMENT_PREFETCH_MAX_MINUTES (default 10) + **per-future
   timeout** ATTACHMENT_PREFETCH_FUTURE_TIMEOUT_SEC (default 45s) ensure a
   stuck HTTP call cannot consume the session budget. Pre-flight guard
   skips the phase entirely if less than the pre-fetch budget is left of
   TIME_BUDGET_MINUTES. Consumers (_has_existing_week_attachment,
   delete_old_excel_attachments, cleanup_untracked_sheet_attachments) all
   accept a missing cache entry and fall back to per-row on-demand lookup.
   ↓
Change detection: SHA256 hash per group key →
   skip unchanged (generated_docs/hash_history.json, capped at 1000 entries)
   ↓
Excel generation (openpyxl) — logo, headers, formatting, totals
   Use safe_merge_cells() (overlap detection); never write oddFooter.right.text
   Output to generated_docs/WR_{wr}_WeekEnding_{MMDDYY}_{timestamp}{variant_suffix}_{hash}.xlsx
   (variant_suffix ∈ {``, `_User_<foreman>`, `_Helper_<foreman>`, `_VacCrew`};
    the workflow's artifact organizer globs WR_*_WeekEnding_*)
   ↓
Audit (audit_billing_changes.py) — price anomaly detection, LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH
   risk levels with delta tracking, optional selective cell-history enrichment
   ↓
Upload back to TARGET_SHEET_ID (parallel; delete old attachment, then upload)
```

**Change-detection key includes `foreman, dept, job`.** Helper Excel files regenerate when new rows are added for past weeks because the hash key includes these fields — do not shorten the key back to `(WR, week, variant, foreman)`.

**Helper rows:** require both `helper_dept` and `helper_foreman` (Job # optional). Rows with both "Helping Foreman Completed Unit?" and "Units Completed?" checkboxes checked appear **only** in helper Excel files, never the main file — that exclusion prevents double-counting when `RES_GROUPING_MODE` is `both` or `helper`.

## Configuration — 30+ Environment Variables

All behavior is controlled by `os.getenv()` with defaults. Full reference lives in `.github/instructions/copilot-setup.instructions.md` and `.github/prompts/configuration-environment.md`.

**Required:** `SMARTSHEET_API_TOKEN`.

**Commonly touched (implemented in `generate_weekly_pdfs.py`):**
- `TARGET_SHEET_ID` (default `5723337641643908`), `AUDIT_SHEET_ID`, `SENTRY_DSN`
- `SKIP_UPLOAD`, `SKIP_CELL_HISTORY`
- `RES_GROUPING_MODE` ∈ {`primary`, `helper`, `both`} (default `both`)
- `TEST_MODE`, `FORCE_GENERATION`, `WR_FILTER` (comma list), `MAX_GROUPS`
- `RESET_HASH_HISTORY=true` for full CI regeneration (hash history is ephemeral in CI)
- `REGEN_WEEKS` (MMDDYY list), `RESET_WR_LIST`, `KEEP_HISTORICAL_WEEKS`
- `DISCOVERY_CACHE_TTL_MIN` (default `10080` = 7 days), `USE_DISCOVERY_CACHE`, `EXTENDED_CHANGE_DETECTION`
- Time-budget family (GitHub Actions only):
  - `TIME_BUDGET_MINUTES` — session graceful-stop budget. Default `0`
    (disabled) for local runs; the weekly workflow sets `165` (2h45m).
    Most recently raised `95` → `165` on 2026-05-26 (alongside the runner
    `timeout-minutes` `110` → `180`); an earlier `80`→ raise on 2026-04-22
    followed a pre-fetch stall that consumed the whole session with zero
    output. Must stay strictly less than the workflow's `timeout-minutes`
    (currently `180`).
  - `ATTACHMENT_PREFETCH_MAX_MINUTES` (default `10`) — phase sub-budget
    for the target-row attachment pre-fetch. Also the threshold for the
    pre-flight guard that skips pre-fetch entirely when the session
    budget is already mostly consumed.
  - `ATTACHMENT_PREFETCH_FUTURE_TIMEOUT_SEC` (default `45`) — per-future
    wait inside the pre-fetch consumer loop. A stuck HTTP call cannot
    block the consumer beyond this; its row falls back to per-row lookup.
- Debug flags: `DEBUG_MODE`, `QUIET_LOGGING`, `PER_CELL_DEBUG_ENABLED`, `FILTER_DIAGNOSTICS`, `FOREMAN_DIAGNOSTICS`, `LOG_UNKNOWN_COLUMNS`, `DEBUG_SAMPLE_ROWS`
- Sentry Logs gate: `SENTRY_ENABLE_LOGS` (default `false`). Keep off by
  default because INFO-path logs can embed row PII; the `before_send_log`
  sanitizer in `generate_weekly_pdfs.py` is the defense-in-depth backstop.

**Documented in `.github/prompts/` but not currently consumed by `generate_weekly_pdfs.py`:** `SKIP_FILE_OPERATIONS`, `DRY_RUN_UPLOADS`, `MOCK_SMARTSHEET_UPLOAD`. Treat these as aspirational until they are wired up — setting them today has no effect on the production pipeline.

## GitHub Actions Workflow — `advanced_options` Parser

`.github/workflows/weekly-excel-generation.yml` drives production. The `workflow_dispatch` surface packs rarely-used controls into a single `advanced_options` field parsed with `tr`/`cut` so operators don't have to hunt through a long input list:

```
max_groups:50,regen_weeks:081725;082425,reset_wr_list:WR123;WR456
```

Do not delete this parser even if the top-level input count is below GitHub's limit today — several operational runbooks depend on this exact `key:value,key:value` format.

**Schedule (UTC crons, `TZ: America/Chicago` inside the job):**
- Weekdays (Mon–Fri): 7 runs/day at UTC `13,15,17,19,21,23,01` (`0 13,15,17,19,21,23,1 * * 1-5`) → roughly every 2 hours during US business hours.
- Weekends (Sat, Sun): 3 runs/day at UTC `15,19,23` (`0 15,19,23 * * 0,6`).
- Weekly deep run: `0 5 * * 1` (UTC Monday 05:00 = Sunday 23:00 CST / Monday 00:00 CDT Central). The job's `if: day==1 && hour==23` guard in Central time is what flips the run into the "weekly comprehensive" branch.

**Runner timeouts (the `core` job in `weekly-excel-generation.yml`):**
- `timeout-minutes: 180` — hard Actions ceiling.
- `TIME_BUDGET_MINUTES: '165'` — Python graceful-stop budget.
- The 15-minute gap is reserved for post-job cache-save and artifact-
  upload steps. Never raise `TIME_BUDGET_MINUTES` without also raising
  `timeout-minutes` by at least as much — otherwise Actions hard-kills
  the job before the graceful stop fires and cache/attachment-upload
  progress is lost.

Other workflows: `docs-changelog.yml` (appends runbook changelog on every merge to `master`), `notion-sync.yml`, `snyk-security.yml`, `system-health-check.yml`, `azure-pipelines.yml` (GitHub → Azure DevOps mirror).

## Smartsheet API & Integration Standards

- Deeply understand and optimize for the Smartsheet API when adding new scripts.
- Account for API rate limits (**300 req/min; PARALLEL_WORKERS capped at 8**), proper pagination, and secure token handling via environment variables.
- Acknowledge platform-specific constraints (e.g. `@cell` does **not** work in certain Smartsheet formula contexts) when writing automated data syncs.
- Never guess column names — always verify against `_validate_single_sheet()` mappings in `generate_weekly_pdfs.py`.

## Current Stack & Ecosystem Context

- **Frontend:** React 18, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (`portal-v2/`).
- **Backend/Database:** Node.js 20+ Express (`portal/`), Python 3.12 in CI (3.11+ locally is fine), Supabase (auth + Postgres + RLS for `portal-v2`).
- **Data Analytics & Visualization:** Power BI, Hex, Excel (`openpyxl`), Google Sheets, `pandas` + `pandera`.
- **CI/CD, Source Control & Error Tracking:** GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps mirror, Sentry (Python + Node + React with source-map upload).
- **Project Management, Operations & Task Tracking:** Smartsheet, Linear, Notion, Todoist, Microsoft Project, Planner.
- **Architecture & Document Management:** Visio, Adobe Acrobat.
- **Constraint:** Respect this existing architecture; integrate seamlessly without breaking changes.

## Conventions (Language-Specific)

- **Python:** PEP 8, type hints, 4-space indent, ≤79 char lines, PEP 257 docstrings. See `.github/instructions/python.instructions.md`.
- **Node.js:** Module system differs by component. **`portal/` is CommonJS** (`"type": "commonjs"`, `require()` / `module.exports`) — do **not** introduce `import`/`export` there. **`portal-v2/` is ES2022+ ESM**. Across both: `async`/`await` only (no callbacks), **prefer `undefined` over `null`**, prefer functions over classes, minimize external deps. See `.github/instructions/nodejs-javascript-vitest.instructions.md`.
- **Testing (Node):** Vitest. Never change production code to make it testable — write tests around the code as-is.
- **Subcontractor pricing:** folder-based discovery is the primary path; see `.github/instructions/subcontractor-pricing-folder-discovery.instructions.md`.

## Architectural Consultant & Language Selection

When proposing new workflows, dynamically evaluate the absolute best technology. Provide a comparative analysis of the current stack versus modern alternatives (e.g. Elixir/Phoenix, Go, Swift) with a definitive recommendation factoring in security, scalability, and integration effort.

## Multi-Disciplinary Best Practices

- **Software Engineering:** Enforce strict typing, clean architecture, modularity, OWASP security standards.
- **Data Analytics:** Ensure high data integrity and accuracy. Use Python + Supabase for heavy processing; leverage Power BI, Hex, or spreadsheet logic for precise operational reporting.
- **Technical Project Management (TPM):** Align architecture with delivery milestones, manage technical debt, ensure seamless CI/CD execution. Map ticketing workflows via Linear; map architecture via Visio.
- **Operational Project Management (OPM):** Track KPIs, crew efficiency, resource allocation. Optimize automated reporting scorecards. Leverage Smartsheet, MS Project, Notion, Todoist. Manage document distribution via Adobe Acrobat.

## GitHub Cloud Action & PR Standards

- **Commit messages:** Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`). Subject line ≤ 50 characters. Detailed bulleted body for complex changes.
- **PR titles:** Clear, descriptive, reference the tracking issue number (e.g. `feat: implement Smartsheet sync (#42)`).
- **PR descriptions** must include three sections:
  1. **Objective** — brief summary of what the PR solves.
  2. **Changes Made** — bulleted list of file-level modifications.
  3. **Production Safety Check** — definitive confirmation that existing production logic remains unbroken.

## Critical Pitfalls (Known Footguns)

- **Hash history is ephemeral in CI** — set `RESET_HASH_HISTORY=true` to force full regeneration.
- **Excel corruption** — always use `safe_merge_cells()` (overlap-detecting); never write `oddFooter.right.text`.
- **Job #** — populated by checking multiple column-name variations (`Job #`, `Job#`, `Job Number`, …); do not collapse the synonyms.
- **GitHub Actions 10-input limit** — keep the `advanced_options` `key:value,key:value` parser intact.
- **Rate limits** — don't raise `PARALLEL_WORKERS` above 8.
- **Do not break the pipeline** — `generate_weekly_pdfs.py` is production-critical. See `.github/prompts/change-detection-troubleshooting.md` and `.github/prompts/error-handling-resilience.md`.

## Second-Brain Write-Back (Repo Convention)

Repo-scoped subagents MUST NOT edit Juan's second brain (the OneDrive `my-wiki`
vault) directly. When a subagent produces durable, cross-session knowledge
(architecture decisions, incident root-causes, new operational rules), it
**RETURNS a compact Second-Brain Write-Back Packet** (what changed · why it
matters · target vault page) in its final message and, if a file is needed,
drops it in `.claude/writeback-pending/<topic>.md`. The **main session** applies
vault edits via the `global-second-brain-writeback-bridge` /
`global-context-continuity` skills, then clears the packet. Never place secrets,
tokens, or env values in a packet. This mirrors the global ClaudeOS contract and
keeps vault writes auditable via the `audit_vault_writes.js` hook. Repo status
itself lands in `.claude/project-state.md`; the navigation map is
`.claude/context-map.md`.
