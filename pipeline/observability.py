"""pipeline.observability -- Sentry telemetry and logging helpers.

``init_sentry()`` wraps the module-scope Sentry init block that previously ran
at L1392 of ``generate_weekly_pdfs.py``. The facade body calls it immediately
after importing this module, preserving the EXACT import-time Sentry trigger
the engine had at module scope (D-04). Leaf pipeline modules MUST NOT call it.

Idempotent via ``_SENTRY_INITIALIZED``. The ``before_send_log`` PII sanitizer
(``sentry_before_send_log``) and the redaction helpers move verbatim from the
facade -- they are a defense-in-depth backstop and must not be weakened.

D-04 import-cycle rule: this module imports ONLY stdlib / third-party at module
level. ``pipeline.config`` is imported lazily INSIDE ``init_sentry()`` and
``_set_sentry_session_tags()`` (config is fully loaded before either runs).

Symbols relocated from ``generate_weekly_pdfs.py`` (Phase 09 Wave 1).

# they only strip recognised PII tokens, leaving the rest of the
# exception message intact so operators can still diagnose the root
# cause from the Sentry dashboard.
# Match any ``WR``-prefixed identifier, not just digit-only tokens.
# Earlier ``\d+`` missed alphanumeric WR values (``WR=ABCD-123``) and
# only partially matched path-traversal suffixes (``WR=1234/../evil``
# would redact only ``1234``, leaking ``/../evil`` through the
# Sentry context). The negative lookahead ``(?![a-zA-Z])`` keeps the
# pattern from over-matching English words that happen to start with
# ``WR`` (e.g. ``WRITE``). The identifier char class accepts word

    log record into a Sentry breadcrumb UNCONDITIONALLY — independent of the
    ``SENTRY_ENABLE_LOGS`` gate that guards the Sentry Logs product (and thus
    ``sentry_before_send_log``). Breadcrumbs attach to any subsequently
    captured event, so a PII-bearing log body — e.g. the subcontractor
    helper-claim attribution fallback WARNING, which names ``WR=`` + helper
    foreman, or the always-on ``PRIMARY GROUP CREATED`` / totals-validation
    INFO lines — would ride onto an unrelated error event and exfiltrate row
    data. ``before_send_log`` never sees these (wrong plane), and the
    sheet-drop scrub only strips frame vars (wrong field). This hook is the
    breadcrumb-plane counterpart, reusing the SINGLE ``_PII_LOG_MARKERS``
    registry so there is no marker drift.

    Two sub-fields carry PII and are handled by two models:
      * ``message`` (free text) — dropped whole if it contains a
        ``_PII_LOG_MARKERS`` entry (the same allow-by-default / deny-on-marker
        model as ``sentry_before_send_log``). Non-log breadcrumbs (navigation,
        http, manual ``add_breadcrumb``) legitimately carry ``message=None``
        and are kept so the debug trail is not gutted.
      * ``data`` (structured key/value) — row-identifier keys in
        ``_PII_BREADCRUMB_DATA_KEYS`` are stripped IN PLACE (a bare ``wr``
        value like ``90093002`` never matches a text marker, so a
        deny-by-key model is required; e.g. the ``orchestrate.py`` skip /
        regenerate crumbs). The breadcrumb + its non-PII keys survive.

    Returns ``None`` to drop, or the (possibly sanitized) crumb to keep. A
    ``message``-marker hit drops the whole crumb (its ``data`` goes with it),
    taking precedence over key-stripping. Fails closed on an inspection error
